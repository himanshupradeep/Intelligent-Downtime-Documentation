## 💡 Problem Statement  
In global automotive manufacturing facilities, **machine downtimes** lead to significant losses. 

<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288161e6-c419-4b6a-93e7-980d6e2121af" />

The traditional process of diagnosing and documenting downtimes is:  
- Manual, slow, and error-prone.  
- Highly dependent on machine experts.  
- Lacking structured feedback for future improvements.
